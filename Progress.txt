Notes/Changes that need to be made:

To Do Log of Tasks:

-GetTestLuck class
-GetSettings class: need to categorize the pick up lines
-In getContacts, handle the condition in which there's no phone number present. Throw an error and ask if user wants to try again?
-Create Custom Buttons and Icon for the App
-Create multiple text files that categorize pick up lines.
-Add a confirmation dialogue box that appears after the user successfully sends the message.
-Handle all of the cases where the user could input invalid information.


Long Term Tasks:
-Add multiple text files to assets and set up a massive switch statement to deal with all of the categories and subsets
-Make it pretty


Completed Log of Tasks:
June 22, 2014
-Currently, GetContacts.java sets the default message to "Hello." 
-Remove ActionBar functionality. (Commented out res/menu code that would create actionbar menu options)
-Fix the bug where names are showing up as duplicates in contact list

July 23, 2014
-Just created the GetTestLuck class. Class doesn't actually do anything at the moment.


Ideas:
Instead of doing sub-categories, do easier version and just do a couple main broad categories. (Easier for now)
