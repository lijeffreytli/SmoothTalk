Notes/Changes that need to be made:

To Do Log of Tasks:
-GetTestLuck class: Add functionality to the buttons
-GetSettings class: need to categorize the pick up lines
-Create Custom Buttons and Icon for the App (Johnny)
-Create multiple text files that categorize pick up lines.
-Add a confirmation dialogue box that appears after the user successfully sends the message.
-Handle all of the cases where the user could input invalid information.


Long Term Tasks:
-Add multiple text files to assets and set up a massive switch statement to deal with all of the categories and subsets
-Make it pretty


Completed Log of Tasks:
June 22, 2014
-Currently, GetContacts.java sets the default message to "Hello." 
-Remove ActionBar functionality. (Commented out res/menu code that would create actionbar menu options)
-Fix the bug where names are showing up as duplicates in contact list

July 23, 2014
-Just created the GetTestLuck class. Class doesn't actually do anything at the moment.

July 28th, 2014
-In getContacts, handle the condition in which there's no phone number present. Throw an error and ask if user wants to try again?
Note: People without phone numbers will not show up as an option

August 23rd, 2014
-For some reason, changing the name Dirty.txt to Cheesy.txt doesn't do anything? still pulls data from Dirty.txt
Note: This was just me being stupid. I didn't change the name in both SendToNumber AND GetContacts.
-GetContacts class is broken: Strictmode error causing the app to crash.
-Added Alert Dialog Box for SendToNumber, allows for user confirmation whether they want to send or not.

Ideas:
Instead of doing sub-categories, do easier version and just do a couple main broad categories. (Easier for now)
