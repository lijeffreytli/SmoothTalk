Notes/Changes that need to be made:

1) In getContacts, handle the condition in which there's no phone number present. Throw an error and ask if user wants to try again?
2) Fix the bug where names are showing up as duplicates in contact list
3) Currently, GetContacts.java sets the default message to "Hello." Create multiple text files that categorize pick up lines.
4) Remove ActionBar functionality.
5) Create Custom Buttons and Icon for the App
